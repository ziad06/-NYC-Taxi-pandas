# NYC-Taxi-pandas
I used python language to solve this problem. First, I imported the library pandas to solve this problem.

Second, I read the data. After that, I calculated the percentile 0.95 of the trip distance and filtered the dataframe depending on the trip distance that exceeded the percentile 0.95.

Finally, I did some aggregation functions to return the greatest 10 number of trips.

To run the code:

1- Download the file.py script

2- The script file.py, the dataset and the dataset taxi+_zone_lookup.csv must be in the same location 

3- Open a terminal and type the word python, or python3 if you have both versions, followed by the file.py dataset name just like this:

python file.py yellow_tripdata_2020-04.csv
